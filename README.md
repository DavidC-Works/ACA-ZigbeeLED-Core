# ACA-ZigbeeLED-Core

## Description
This repository will contain the core Zigbee logic, shared modules, and reusable components that support multiple Zigbee LED-related projects on the ESP32-C6. It provides the foundational layers for device behavior, communication, and code reuse.

**End Goal:**  
To create a modular set of Zigbee core utilities that can be reused across end-device, router, and coordinator implementations in future projects.
